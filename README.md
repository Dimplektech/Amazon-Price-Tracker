# Amazon Price Tracker

This project is a Python script designed to monitor the price of a specified Amazon product
and notify the user via email when the price drops below a defined threshold. The script
leverages web scraping with BeautifulSoup to extract the price from the product page, and
it uses SMTP to send email notifications.


## Features
- Scrapes Amazon product page to retrieve the current price and product title.
- Sends an email alert if the price falls below Â£100.


## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `requests` for handling HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup4` for parsing HTML content
- `smtplib` for sending email alerts
- `dotenv` to manage sensitive data
